Please note: this project is still in progress. If you would like to see code for a complete app, please visit https://github.com/jamesdavidyu/grs. For now, users may securley sign up for an account, log in and sign out, reserve cars 1 and 2, and see that the parking spot has been reserved. Next steps are to allow users to update reservations, apply these functionalities to all cars, add logic for reservation times, and complete check reservation functionality (as of 3/5/25).

Welcome to Parking API, a small app where you can "reserve" parking spots and check for available parking spots based on datetimes. The API is written in TypeScript with Node.js, connected to a MongoDB database. Also in this repository are the .ejs and .js (jQuery, Bootstrap) files that render the UI to interact with the API. This app is deployed on Render and the database is hosted through MongoDB Atlas.
