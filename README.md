Please note: this project is still in progress. If you would like to see code for a complete app, please visit https://github.com/jamesdavidyu/grs. For now, users may securley sign up for an account, log in and sign out, reserve cars 1 and 2, and see that the car has been reserved. Next steps are to allow users to update reservations, apply these functionalities to all cars, add logic for reservation times, and complete check reservation functionality (as of 3/5/25).
